## üó∫Ô∏èWhere is here?
It's a digital garden! I'm here to share what I'm doing, what I'm learning, as well as technical blogs and more.

I want to be able to open myself to the outside world through this door. If you find interesting and valuable content here, if you are also interested in what I am doing, I sincerely invite you to communicate with me
### MOC
A MOC is a Map of Content. Thanks to the double-chain feature of obsidian, I can use more fine-grained links here to organically link related content together to form an organic knowledge network. Mocs are similar to #tags, but can be embedded in articles at a more granular level.

You can choose from the MOC keywords below to enter and watch.
### Recent Notes
Of course, you can also read recent notes based on timeline.
